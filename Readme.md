# Fitness Challenges Smart Contract

## Vision

The Fitness Challenges project aims to create a decentralized platform where users can create and participate in fitness challenges, with a reward pool to incentivize healthy activities. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures transparent reward distribution, providing an engaging and motivating environment for users to achieve their fitness goals.

## Features

- **Create Fitness Challenge**: Users can create a fitness challenge, set a description, and allocate a reward pool to encourage participation.
- **Reward Participants**: Challenge creators can reward participants upon successful completion of the challenge, creating a transparent and fair incentive system.
- **Manage Challenge Status**: The platform tracks the challenge's status and automatically deactivates it when the reward pool is depleted.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x5ddc959315ef92939cded1664e30ea55d0c4640f00a1d9ba187d74ff6fc3e49e` (Replace with the actual contract address once deployed)

## How It Works

1. **Create Challenge**:
   - Users call the `create_challenge` function to create a new fitness challenge.
   - The function takes the challenge description and reward pool as parameters, storing the information along with the creator's address on the blockchain.
2. **Reward Participant**:
   - The challenge creator can call the `reward_participant` function to reward participants upon completing the challenge.
   - The contract checks if the challenge is active and if there are enough funds in the reward pool to issue the reward.
   - Once the reward is issued, the reward pool is updated accordingly, and the challenge is marked inactive if the pool is depleted.

## Future Scope

- **On-Chain Payment Handling**: Implement the logic to automatically transfer rewards to participants using Aptos tokens, ensuring secure reward distribution.
- **Participant Enrollment**: Add functionality for participants to enroll in challenges and track their progress through smart contracts.
- **Proof of Completion**: Introduce a mechanism to verify the successful completion of fitness challenges by participants (e.g., using wearable data or activity logs).
- **Leaderboards**: Develop a leaderboard system to display top participants for each challenge, adding a competitive element.
- **Fitness Challenge Types**: Allow different types of challenges (e.g., running, cycling, strength training) and add options for group challenges.
- **Community Voting**: Enable community voting on challenges, where users can vote on the next fitness challenge they want to participate in.
- **NFT Rewards**: Issue NFT badges to participants as a token of achievement for completing challenges, adding another layer of motivation.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, users can create challenges, and participants can be rewarded through the smart contract functions.
